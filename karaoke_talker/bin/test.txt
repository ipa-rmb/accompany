3 [start]
3 Dashing through the snow
3 In a one-horse open sleigh
3 O'er the fields we go
3 Laughing all the way
3 Bells on bob tails ring
3 Making spirits bright
3 What fun it is to laugh and sing
3 A sleighing song tonight
3 [clear]
3 [clear]
3 Oh, Jingle bells, jingle bells
3 Jingle all the way
3 Oh, what fun
3 it is to ride
3 In a one-horse open sleigh.
3 Jingle bells, jingle bells
3 Jingle all the way 
3 Oh, what fun
3 it is to ride
3 In a one-horse open sleigh.
3 [clear]
