The document describes how to operate the UvA human detector and
tracker.

--------------------------------------------------------
---- Preliminary, with any luck this is already done
--------------------------------------------------------
First install all software. Then add your hosts to
'accompany/accompany_uva/launch/machines.launch'. Make sure that:

1) All hosts can resolve the hostname off each host.

2) The user has password free ssh access from the current host to all
others. Use 'ssh-keygen' and 'ssh-copy-id <hostname>' to make this
happen.

3) All ROS_PACKAGE_PATH's on remote hosts are set in the main ros
setup file (/opt/ros/.../setup.sh) in contrast to a user file
(~/.bashrc).

Then add your hosts to the '*All.launch' scripts below.
--------------------------------------------------------


Commands:

-Start cameras on all hosts:

  roslaunch accompany_uva startCamAll.launch


-Start detection of humans on all hosts:

  roslaunch accompany_uva startDetectAll.launch 


-Start tracking humans on current host:

  roslaunch accompany_uva startTrack.launch [machine:=<hostname>]


-View tracked humans on current host:

  roslaunch accompany_uva viewTrack.launch
